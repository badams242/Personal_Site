        <h1>The Zoo Project</h1>
        <p>This project I had build a page that will make it easier for the new interns to identify each animal and
            understand their needs and behaviors.</p>

        <h2>Grocery List Project</h2>
        <p>So with project made a list for grocery shopping making it a lot easier and decided to move it online instead
            of on paper. The goal is to create an HTML file that has food photos, different categories of grocery items
            and list the different items</p>

        <h3>Secure Vault Project</h3>
        <p>This project had to create a vault that requires three mathematical calculations to generate the three codes
            in a combination. Use the JavaScript console or the script block within an HTML page to create three
            variables. Each variable will be the result of each calculation (three in total). The combination of the
            lock is 10 - 40 - 39.</p>
